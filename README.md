# CiscoMDS_Zones
This python script will print the zoning configuration for a Cisco MDS switch to the 'zoning.txt' file.
The script will check if there exists a file with the name inputs.json to get the input. If there is no such file  
then it will prompt the user.

The zone will be done as single-initiator-single-target.

You can copy and paste the content of 'zoning.txt' directly into the switch, but be careful because  
the configuration will overwrite the active zoneset for the vsan.
